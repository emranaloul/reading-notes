# Templating with Mustache
* **Javascript templating** is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

* **Mustache** is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

## Mustache-Express

If you intend you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express. Mustache Express lets you use Mustache and Express together easily.

To install:

* With Yarn:

$ yarn add mustache-express

* or with NPM:

$ npm install mustache --save

# Flexbox

### Background
* The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

* Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based)

### Basics and terminology

the main idea behind the flex layout explained in the below photo:

* **main axis** – The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property (see below).
* **main-start | main-end** – The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.
* **main size** – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.
* **cross axis** – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
* **cross-start | cross-end** – Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.
* **cross size** – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.

### Flexbox properties

* **flex-start (default)**: items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.
* **flex-end**: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.
* **start**: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.
* **end**: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.
* **left**: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.
* **right**: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like end.
center: items are centered along the line
* **space-between**: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
* **space-around**: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
* **space-evenly**: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.

#### align-items

* **normal (default)**: items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.
* **flex-start / start**: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.
* **flex-end / end**: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.
* **center**: items centered in the container
* **space-between**: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
* **space-around**: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line
* **space-evenly**: items are evenly distributed with equal space around them
* **stretch**: lines stretch to take up the remaining space
