# How to Solve Programming Problems
## A simple set of steps

1. Read the problem completely twice.
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps.
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
3. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

# How to be more productive 

* #### Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

* #### “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness

* #### Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy
* #### You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them

### **In Conclusion:**

* **How do you value your time?**

Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour?
* **How many activities were a true waste of time?** 

Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.

# How to think like a programmer
## **Why is learning  problem solving important?**

Problem solving is the meta-skill and we all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

### the best way to solve problems:
1. Having a framework.
2. Practicing it.

* **what should I do when I encounter a new problem?**
1. Understand.
2. Plan.
1. Divide.
1. Stuck?.

### Practice:

In fact, a common pattern amongst successful people is their habit of practicing “micro problem-solving.” 

# 5 Whys!

## When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis

`You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.`

## How to Use the 5 Whys
1. **Assemble a Team**: Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.
2. **Define the Problem**: If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures."
Then, write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"
3. **Ask the First "Why?"**: Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.
4. **Ask "Why?" Four More Times**:

*  Whys Example (Multiple Lanes)

5. **Know When to Stop**: If you identified more than one reason in Step 3, repeat this process for each of the different branches of your analysis until you reach a root cause for each one.

1. **Address the Root Cause(s)**: Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.
1. **Monitor Your Measures**: Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
