#  AWS: Events

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server**

* Key Authentication	 
* HTTPS
* CORS
* oAuth2
* Finegrain Access Control
* Rate Limiting

2. **List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each**

In general, you will find RDS, DynamoDB, and DocumentDB to be good initial choices with wide support for tooling, languages, and flexible data usage patterns. In this article, we discuss a variety of databases: relational, document, key-value, graph, in-memory, and search.

3. **What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**

Standard queues guarantee that a message is delivered at least once and duplicates can be introduced into the queue. FIFO queues ensure a message is delivered exactly once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it; duplicates are not introduced into the queue.

4. **How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**

The response "hops through the internet and is eventually received" by the client that originated the request.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* **Serverless API:** is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.

* **Triggers:** is an SQL procedure that is executed when a record is added or deleted. It is used to maintain referential integrity in the database. A trigger may also execute a stored procedure.

* **Dynamo vs Mongo:** DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas. ... DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents. DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions.

* **Dynamoose vs Mongoose:** **Dynamoose** is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar, **Mongoose** is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB

## Preparation Materials

### AWS SQS vs SNS

* SQS: Simple Queue Service.
* SNS: Simple Notification Service.

* SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Amazon SNS is a fast, flexible, fully managed push notification service that lets you send individual messages or to bulk messages to large numbers of recipients. Amazon SNS makes it simple and cost effective to send push notifications to mobile device users, email recipients or even send messages to other distributed services.

* SQS (Simple Queue Service)

SQS is distributed queuing system. Messages are not pushed to receivers. Receivers have to poll SQS to receive messages. Messages can’t be received by multiple receivers at the same time. Any one receiver can receive a message, process and delete it. Other receivers do not receive the same message later.

* Key Differences:

**Entity Type**

SQS : Queue (similar to JMS, MSMQ).
SNS : Topic-Subscriber (Pub/Sub system).
**Message consumption**

SQS : Pull Mechanism — Consumers poll messages from SQS.
SNS : Push Mechanism — SNS pushes messages to consumers.

**Persistence**

SQS : Messages are persisted for some duration is no consumer available. The retention period value is from 1 minute to 14 days. The default is 4 days.
SNS : No persistence. Whichever consumer is present at the time of message arrival, get the message and the message is deleted. If no consumers available then the message is lost.
In SQS the message delivery is guaranteed but in SNS it is not.

**Consumer Type**

SQS : All the consumers are supposed to be identical and hence process the messages in exact same way.
SNS : All the consumers are (supposed to be) processing the messages in different ways.
