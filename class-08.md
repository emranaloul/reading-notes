 # Links
* Links are created using the < a > element. Users can click on anything
between the opening < a > tag and the closing < /a > tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

We can use the < a > element as below:

1. Linking to Other Sites.
2.  Linking to Other Pages
on the Same Site.

Directory Structure:

1. **Structure**: The diagram on the right shows
the directory structure for a
fictional entertainment listings
website called ExampleArts.
2. **Relationships**: The relationship between
files and folders on a website
is described using the same
terminology as a family tree.
2. **Homepages**: The main homepage of a site
written in HTML (and the
homepages of each section in a
child folder) is called index.html.

* **Relative URLs**: Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.
### Relative link types:

* **Email Links**: To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the < a >
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.

* **Opening Links in
a New Window**: If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
< a > tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.
