How Websites Are Created?
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.

How the Web Works?
When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site.
Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer.
The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.
The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
HTML Structure
We will introduce the HTML though the following points:
HTML Describes the Structure of Pages.
HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages.
Attributes Tell Us More About Elements.
The main components of the HTML are Body, Head & Title.
Extra Markup
Command | Purpose ——-|——– < !– – > | If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user’s browser, you can add the text between these characters ID Attribute | It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page Class Attribute | Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document Block Elements | Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements. Inline Elements | Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements. Grouping Text & Elements In a Block | The < div > element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. Grouping Text & Elements Inline | The < span > element acts like an inline equivalent of the < div > element IFrames | An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. Information About Your Pages | The < meta > element lives inside the < head > element and contains information about that web page.

HTML5 Layout
HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page, The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple < div > elements), Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements. To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

The following commands used instead of < div >:

< header > < footer >.
< nav >.
< article >.
< aside >.
< section >.
< hgroup >.
< figure > < figcaption >.
< div >.
HTML Process & Design
The first and important thing when you are willing to design a website is to know who is the targeted audience, the design will be much different depends on the useres.

Also you need to know why the users are visiting your website that will make you able to design motivated structure for the website then you will be able to arrange to website to fulfill users requirments and goals.

Before design the website one of the important thing you should care about is the site map, it will help you to start the job and arrange all buttons as required, below is an example for the site map:

sitemap

Also you need to care about one more thing, the wireframe, is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of asite. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require, below is an example for the wireframe:

Visual hierarchy is also an important thing to care about because this will help you to communicate with the users virtually.

Javascript Introduction
## SCRIPTS ### defenition of the script:

script: A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Scripts for the developer is like the recipes, handbooks or manuals, instructs the developer how to create a program.

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve, we can list the steps as below:

DEFINE THE GOAL
DESIGN THE SCRIPT
CODE EACH STEP
You need to know that the computer runs the codes sequently, one-by-one, so you need to understand this before writing a code and run it.

One of the important steps you can do before start programming is to make a flowchart, below is an example for flowchart:

EXPRESSIONS
There Are two types of expressions:

Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
Expressions that use two or More values to return a Single value.
We have to kinds of operators:

Assignment operators.
Comparison operators.
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
FUNCTION
Function: let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task
Types of function:

Basic function.
Declaring function.
Calling function.
