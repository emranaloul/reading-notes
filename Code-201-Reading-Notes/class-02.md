# **Text**
### Structural:
 the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.

 Structural markup | Tag
-------|------
Headings | < h1 >, < h2 >.. , < h6 >
Paragraphs | < p >
Bold & Italic | < b > & < i >
Superscript & Subscript | < sup > & < sub >
Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules | < br /> & < hr />

### Semantic:
which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on.

Semantic markup | tag
-------|------
Strong & Emphasis | < strong > & < em >
Quotations | < blockquote > & < q > 
Abbreviations & Acronyms | < abbr >
Citations & Definitions | < cite > & < dfn >
Author Details | < address >
Changes to Content | < ins > & < del > & < s >

# **Introducing CSS**
* CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear.
* CSS Associates Style
rules with HTML
elements.
* CSS Properties Affect
How Elements Are
Displayed.

There are two types of using CSS:
1. External CSS
1. Internal CSS

**Basic Selectors Types**

# **Basic Javascript Instructions**

First of all we will define **the statement**:
 a script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step.
* To write a comment that stretches over more than
one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with
the /* characters and ending with the * / characters.
* In a single-line comment, anything that follows the
two forward slash characters // on that line will not
be processed by the JavaScript interpreter.
#### WHAT IS A VARIABLE?
A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in **variables**.

#### How to declare **Variables**:
using the formatting below we can declare the variable:
Var quantity; 
#### How to assign variables a value:
using the formatting below we can assign a value for the variable:
quantity = 3;
* ### Types of Javascript data:
1. NUMERIC
2. STRING
1. BOOLEAN
* #### Operators:
1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: color = 'beige';
2. COMPARISON OPERATORS: buy = 3 > 5;
2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS: area = 3 * 2;
3. LOGICAL OPERATORS: buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);
2. STRING OPERATORS: greeting= 'Hi ' + 'Molly';

# **Decisions & Loops**
* ### Rely upon the following three concepts To determine which path to take:
1. EVALUATIONS
2. DECISIONS
3. LOOPS

* ## Evaluation Condition
Operator | Purpose
---------|---------
== | is equal to
!= | not equal to
=== | strict equal to
!== | strict not equal to
< | less than
'>' | greater than
<= | less than or equal
'>= | greater than or equal

* ## Logical Operators
Operator | Purpose
--------|--------
&& | logical and
!! | logical or
! | logical not

* ### If Statement:
defenition: the if statement evaluates(of checks) a condition. if the condition evaluates to true, any statement in the subsequnet code block are executed.

below is an example for if statement in Javascript:
