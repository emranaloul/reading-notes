# Chart.js
## Drawing a line chart
1. To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart.
1. Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element
2. Inside the same script tags we need to create our data, in this instance it’s an object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart.

## Drawing a pie chart
1. We need the canvas element.
2. Next, we need to get the context and to instantiate the chart.
3. we need to create the data. This data is a little different to the line chart because the pie chart is simpler, we just need to supply a value and a color for each section.
1. Then we’ll add our options.
 ## Drawing a bar chart
 1. We add the canvas element.
 2. We retrieve the element and create the graph.
 1. we add in the bar chart’s data.

 ### The < canvas > element: 
 At first sight a < canvas> looks like the < img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the < canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height.

 ### The rendering context:
 The < canvas> element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown.
