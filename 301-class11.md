# EJS
 * **EJS** is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

## Options
* cache Compiled functions are cached, requires filename
* filename Used by cache to key caches, and for includes
* root Set project root for includes with an absolute path (e.g, /file.ejs). Can be array to try to resolve include from multiple directories.
* views An array of paths to use when resolving includes with relative paths.
* context Function execution context
* compileDebug When false no debug instrumentation is compiled
* client Returns standalone compiled function
* delimiter Character to use for inner delimiter, by default '%'
* openDelimiter Character to use for opening delimiter, by default '<'
* closeDelimiter Character to use for closing delimiter, by default '>'
* debug Outputs generated function body
* strict When set to `true`, generated function is in strict mode
* _with Whether or not to use with() {} constructs. If false then the locals will be stored in the locals object. (Implies `--strict`)
* localsName Name to use for the object storing local variables when not using with Defaults to locals
* rmWhitespace Remove all safe-to-remove whitespace, including leading and trailing whitespace. It also enables a safer version of -%> line slurping for all scriptlet tags (it does not strip new lines of tags in the middle of a line).
* escape The escaping function used with <%= construct. It is used in rendering and is .toString()ed in the generation of client functions. (By default escapes XML).
* outputFunctionName Set to a string (e.g., 'echo' or 'print') for a function to print output inside scriptlet tags.
* async When true, EJS will use an async function for rendering. (Depends on async/await support in the JS runtime.

## Tags
* <% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
* <%_ ‘Whitespace Slurping’ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it
* <%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
* <%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template
* <%# Comment tag, no execution, no output
* <%% Outputs a literal '<%'
* %> Plain ending tag
* -%> Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline
* _%> ‘Whitespace Slurping’ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it

## Includes
Includes are relative to the template with the include call. (This requires the 'filename' option.) For example if you have "./views/users.ejs" and "./views/user/show.ejs" you would use <%- include('user/show'); %>.

You'll likely want to use the raw output tag (<%-) with your include to avoid double-escaping the HTML output.

## CLI
EJS ships with a full-featured command-line interface. Options are similar to those used in JavaScript code:

cache Compiled functions are cached, requires filename
-o / --output-file FILE Write the rendered output to FILE rather than stdout.
-f / --data-file FILE Must be JSON-formatted. Use parsed input from FILE as data for rendering.
-i / --data-input STRING Must be JSON-formatted and URI-encoded. Use parsed input from STRING as data for rendering.
-m / --delimiter CHARACTER Use CHARACTER with angle brackets for open/close (defaults to %).
-p / --open-delimiter CHARACTER Use CHARACTER instead of left angle bracket to open.
-c / --close-delimiter CHARACTER Use CHARACTER instead of right angle bracket to close.
-s / --strict When set to `true`, generated function is in strict mode
-n / --no-with Use 'locals' object for vars rather than using `with` (implies --strict).
-l / --locals-name Name to use for the object storing local variables when not using `with`.
-w / --rm-whitespace Remove all safe-to-remove whitespace, including leading and trailing whitespace.
-d / --debug Outputs generated function body
-h / --help Display this help message.
-V/v / --version Display the EJS version.
