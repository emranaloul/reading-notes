# SQL
**SQL** (Structured Query Language) : is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. 
**Relational databases**:  represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables.
### SELECT queries 101
To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries.
* Select query for a specific columns

``` SELECT column, another_column, … FROM mytable; ```

### Queries with constraints 
Now we know how to select for specific columns of data from a table, but if you had a table with a hundred million rows of data, reading through all the rows would be inefficient and perhaps even impossible.

Operator | Condition
-----------|-------
=, !=, < <=, >, >= | Standard numerical operators
BETWEEN … AND … | Number is within range of two values (inclusive)
NOT BETWEEN … AND …	| Number is not within range of two values (inclusive)	
IN (…) | Number exists in a list
NOT IN (…) | Number does not exist in a list	

### Queries with constraints

Operator | Condition
-|-
= | Case sensitive exact string comparison (notice the single equals)	
!= or <>	| Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison	
LIKE | Case insensitive exact string comparison	
NOT LIKE	| Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison	
% | Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	
_ | Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	
IN (…) |String exists in a list	
NOT IN (…)	| String does not exist in a list	

### Filtering and sorting Query results
Even though the data in a database may be unique, the results of any particular query may not be – take our Movies table for example, many different movies can be released the same year. In such cases, SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword.
