# Images
To add an image into the page
you need to use an < img >
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:

* **src**:
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site.
* **alt**:
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

You will also often see an < img >
element use two other attributes
that specify its size:

* **height**:
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.
* **width**:
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.

Here are three
examples of image placement
that produce different results:

1. *before a paragraph*:
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.
2. *inside the start of a
paragraph*:
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.
3. *in the middle of a
paragraph*:
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in.
### We can align the images using align command horizontally or vertically as below:
* Horizontally: left or right.
* Vertically: top, middle and bottom.

### There are three Rules for Creating Images:
1. Save images in
the right format. 
1. Save images at
the right size.
1. Use the correct
resolution.
# Colors

The importancy of the colors is that it will bring the like to the site and is will help
convey the mood and evokes reactions.

* ### There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
1. **RGB values**: These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up
1. **hex codes**: These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign.
1. **color names**: There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers.

* **Contrast**: Contrast
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

* ## **CSS3**:

CSS3 provide 3 more technique to color your site:

1. **RGBA**: opacity was added to specify the opacity of an element.
1. **HSL**: means hue, saturation and lightness selection.
2. **HSLA**: transparency was added to specify the transparency of an element.
